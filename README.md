# atomic-habits-worksheets
These are printable PDF worksheets for the book _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear. I designed these worksheets because reading the book alone (and not using Clear's strategies) doesn't really help you make a difference in your life. These worksheets allow you to meticulously standardize and plan your habits and strategies so that you can make the most of _Atomic Habits_.

However, reading the book (and probably taking notes) in addition to doing the worksheets will help you get the most value. (So, don't just do the worksheets, as they are only meant to help you make and strengthen your habits. The book will teach you the general strategies that you will then leverage.)

Here are some important points:
* Your systems (i.e. habits) hold more importance than your goals. “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” - James Clear
  - Your goals aren't enough to make you reach your full potential. The way you carry them out has everything to do with it, though. In fact, if you ignore your goals entirely and just focus on your systems, that can still get you where you want to go.

How to make good habits:
1st Law: Make it obvious.
2nd Law: Make it attractive.
3rd Law: Make it easy.
4th Law: Make it satisfying.

How to break bad habits:
Inversion of the 1st Law: Make it invisible.
Inversion of the 2nd Law: Make it unattractive.
Inversion of the 3rd Law: Make it difficult.
Inversion of the 4th Law: Make it unsatisfying.

That being said, I hope these worksheets are helpful for you.
